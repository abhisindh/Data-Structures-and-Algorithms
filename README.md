# Data Structures and Algorithms - Practice Codes

## Introduction

Greetings and welcome to this repository dedicated to data structures and algorithms! I am excited to share my learning journey with you as I delve into the world of data structures and algorithms using the C language. Since I am relatively new to this domain, I anticipate that some of the code implementations might contain errors or mistakes. However, I am genuinely committed to improving my skills and deepening my understanding of these fundamental concepts.

## File Structure

### [Data Structures]()

Within this directory, you will find implementations of essential data structures using C. As I am still in the learning phase, I must acknowledge that there might be room for improvement in some of the codes. My primary goal is to gain hands-on experience and a better grasp of the functionalities of each data structure. The following data structures are included:

- **[Dynamic Array]():** A dynamic array, also known as a vector, is a resizable array that automatically adjusts its size to accommodate new elements efficiently. It allows for dynamic memory allocation, making it an invaluable tool when dealing with varying amounts of data. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)

- **[Linked List]():** I have implemented both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists to understand their intricacies. Linked lists offer flexibility in memory management and enable efficient insertions, deletions, and traversals. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

- **[Stack]():** The stack data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and supports common operations like push (addition), pop (removal), and peek (viewing the top element). I have worked on this structure to better understand its usage in various algorithms. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))

- **[Queue]():** Implementing a queue data structure with standard enqueue (addition) and dequeue (removal) operations was an enlightening experience. It is fundamental for scenarios where elements need to be processed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

### [Algorithms]()

This directory focuses on the implementation and analysis of various algorithms in C. Given my current learning stage, I acknowledge that some of the algorithms may not be as optimal as they could be. My aim here is to understand the logic behind each algorithm and analyze their efficiency. The following algorithms are included:

- **[Sorting Algorithms]():** I have implemented popular sorting algorithms such as Heap Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and more. While these implementations should work for general cases, I understand that further optimizations might be possible. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)

- **[Searching Algorithms]():** The implementations of searching algorithms like Binary Search and Linear Search aim to provide efficient ways of finding elements in various datasets. I am continuously exploring ways to improve their effectiveness. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)

- **[Bit Manipulation Algorithms]():** Bit manipulation is a fascinating area that finds applications in low-level programming and certain algorithms. My implementations of bit manipulation algorithms may require further scrutiny for accuracy and efficiency. [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation)
